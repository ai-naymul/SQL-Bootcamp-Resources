## SELECT Statement

`SELECT` is the most common statement being used and it allows us to retrieve information from a specific table

### Example's of SELECT statement

The main concept of the SELECT statement syntax is:

```SELECT column_name FROM table_name```

This query can be perform also by the following ways, like-

1. If you want to get retrieve info from multiple columns in a table you can use it in the following way:

```SELECT column_1,column_2 FROM table_name;```

##### Note: The uppercase in the syntax is compulsory you can also use the lower cases to perform query,both works either way. And we use the colon sign to define a line is finshed(It's optional if you don't give it will be works)

2. If you want to retrieve all the info from the table you can use it in the following way:

```SELECT * FROM table_name;```


Here are some query's you can perform on the sample DVDrental database to get a clear underastanding of this statement:

1. ```SELECT * FROM actor;```
2. ```SELECT first_name,last_name FROM actor;```
